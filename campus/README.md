campus
========

A flythrough of a Virtual University of Missouri. The camera follows a predefined cubic Bezier curve. The camera's focal point simultaneously follows another Bezier curve. The rate of movement along each path is constant between path point--when the camera appears to slow, it is the result of Bezier points defined very close together.

The buildings are all polygon mesh models, the points of which were defined by me as I eyeballed many angles of archived campus photographs going back to the late 1800s. The models include The Columns and Jesse Hall, Engineering East and West, Eliis Library, Townsend, Swallow, Hill, and Tate Halls, Faurot Field and the Mizzou Arena.

This is a screenshot and demo of the running animation:
