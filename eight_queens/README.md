eight_queens
=============

A screensaver-style visualization of a recursive solution to the eight queens problem. Moves are printed on the screen as they happen. The starting point and order of moves are randomized.

The curve of the outer edge of the queen is revolved around a vertical axis to create the surface. The shape was determined by me eyeballing an actual wooden queen piece and drawing dots on an index card.

For some reason, the texuring of the queens is all inside-out or backwards.
