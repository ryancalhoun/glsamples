solar
=========

This is a model solar system, in which all moons and planets revolve at configurable speeds and distances. The supplied solarsystem.txt is a definition of our own solar system, including Pluto.

Keyboard flythrough of the solar system includes 'j' and 'k' to move up and down, 'i' and 'o' to move in and out, 'h' and 'l' to revolve the point of view. The camera always points at the sun. Pressing 's' toggles orbital lines, and 'q' quits.

As with most of the other examples here, this was all done pre-Orange book, and the shading is horrible. The gaps between polygons in the sun didn't show up on my ATI graphics card when I wrote this in 2007, but they sure do now.

This is a screenshot and demo of the running animation:
